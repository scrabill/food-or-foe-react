# Food or Foe?

![Screenshot of Food or Foe?](frontend/public/screenshot.png)

How many food emoji can you correctly identify in 30 seconds?

Each correct answer is worth 1 point. A wrong answer decreases your score by 1 point.

At the end of a round, add your name and score to the leaderboard!

Happy guessing!

## Contributing

Is this game missing your favorite emoji?

To contribute, please [make a pull request](https://github.com/scrabill/food-or-foe-react/pull/new/master) with the name of the emoji, it's character and if it is a food or not to the [backend/db/seeds.rb](https://github.com/scrabill/food-or-foe-react/blob/master/backend/db/seeds.rb) file.

Here's how I would add üçî (hamburger)

```ruby
Emoji.create(slug: "hamburger", character: "üçî", is_food?: true)
```

The [Unicode emoji list](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html) is a great resource for finding interesting emojis to contribute.
